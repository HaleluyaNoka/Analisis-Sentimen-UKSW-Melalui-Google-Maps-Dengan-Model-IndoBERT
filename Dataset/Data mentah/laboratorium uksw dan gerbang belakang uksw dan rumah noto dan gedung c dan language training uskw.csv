LTC opens several classes for different purposes. You can study in groups, or request private classes too. They also have Indonesian language courses for foreigners. Apart from language learning, there are translation services as well. They also had a film watching session together. You can follow their Instagram @ltc.uksw to access the latest information updates and class and course schedules.",,,,,,,,language training uksw

There are many programs from elementary classes to TOEFL/IELTS preparation classes. You can also choose the type, public or private class. Because it is under the auspices of UKSW, almost all of the teachers are taken from lecturers, you know. So it's like taking a lecture class and it's quality. The place itself is on the 6th floor of the UKSW Library. There are lots of rooms and they are all comfortable, with air conditioning and monitors for studying. There are also 2 balconies here with beautiful views, perfect for relaxing for a while before class. Anyway, I highly recommend this place!",,,,,,,,language training uksw
